Fireworks are held in Canberra a couple of times a year (color shooting, as our people say).

Fireworks, or Fireworks to call it, was held on the occasion of Canberra Day.

Par puta godisnje u Kanberi odrzavaju se vatrometi (pucanje u boji, kako to nasi kazu).

Fireworks ili Vatromet kako bi ga mi nazvali, odrzan je povodom dana Kanbere.
